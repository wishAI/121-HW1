\item Suppose you have embarked on a journey of discovery into a land occupied by sword wielders, villains, and worms. Sword wielders always tell the truth, villains always lie, and worms flip a coin to decide whether they tell the truth or lie, every time they speak. One day, your path is blocked by three fair beasts named Asuna, Sinon, and Winry Rockbell, who will only allow you to pass if you can solve their riddle, which is posted on a nearby sign. The sign reads, ``Here stands a sword wielder, a villain, and a worm. Name each and you may proceed!'' The fair beasts, in turn, say the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Asuna: {\Fontlukas I am a sword wielder!}
 \item Sinon: {\Fontlukas Asuna is telling the truth.}
 \item Winry Rockbell: {\Fontlukas I am a worm.}
 \end{itemize}
 Who is the sword wielder, who is the villain, and who is the worm? Prove that your choices are correct by arguing that each of the other options leads to an impossibility.
